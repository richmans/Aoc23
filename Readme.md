# Advent of code 2023
For this year of aoc, i decided to go mobile! All solutions are written and run on an iPhone using the excellent [Pythonista app](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/).

Please consider that this code does not reflect my usual coding style. The limited screen space and slow typing encourages bad coding practices such as really short variable names and deeply nested code.

So please do try this at home but not in production, and please don't judge me by it!
